# Game Description

Rock Paper Scissors is a hand game played between two players. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes using an outstretched hand: rock (a closed fist), paper (an open hand), or scissors (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended).

The game follows a simple set of rules:

1.Rock beats scissors
2.Scissors beat paper
3.Paper beats rock

The objective is to select a gesture that defeats the gesture chosen by the opponent. The game is often used as a method of selection in a way similar to flipping a coin or drawing straws to randomly select a person for some purpose.
